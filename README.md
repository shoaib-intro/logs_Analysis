# logs_Analysis with DeepLog
*Deeplog Anomaly detection*

> `log_value_vector` file contains loglines
> `Log_key_Anomaly.ipynb` contains first model
> `Parameters_Anomaly` contains second model
> `Parameter Anomaly Model` contains Second model from Demo

> *`log_value_vector` file contains Noramal data where `model.h5` is trained with `encoder.save`*

> *`Anomaly` file contains same as normal but with `parameter anomalies`*

> Question: I already have executed first model and output is in `EPA_trace_df` while I want to implement parameters Anomaly detection for all log keys instead only one.
please ask me anytime I am waiting you!
